JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript is the scripting language of the Web.
JavaScript is used in millions of Web pages to add functionality, validate forms, detect browsers, and 
much more.
Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is used in millions of Web pages to improve the design, validate forms, detect browsers, create 
cookies, and much more.
JavaScript is the most popular scripting language on the Internet, and works in all major browsers, such as 
Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.
What is JavaScript?
 JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to HTML pages 
 JavaScript is a scripting language 
 A scripting language is a lightweight programming language 
 JavaScript is usually embedded directly into HTML pages 
 JavaScript is an interpreted language (means that scripts execute without preliminary compilation) 
 Everyone can use JavaScript without purchasing a license 
Java and JavaScript are two completely different languages in both concept and design!
Java (developed by Sun Microsystems) is a powerful and much more complex programming language - in 
the same category as C and C++.
What can a JavaScript Do ?
 JavaScript gives HTML designers a programming tool - HTML authors are normally not 
programmers, but JavaScript is a scripting language with a very simple syntax! Almost anyone can 
put small "snippets" of code into their HTML pages 
 JavaScript can put dynamic text into an HTML page - A JavaScript statement like this: 
document.write("<h1>" + name + "</h1>") can write a variable text into an HTML page 
 JavaScript can react to events - A JavaScript can be set to execute when something happens, 
like when a page has finished loading or when a user clicks on an HTML element 
 JavaScript can read and write HTML elements - A JavaScript can read and change the content 
of an HTML element 
 JavaScript can be used to validate data - A JavaScript can be used to validate form data before 
it is submitted to a server. This saves the server from extra processing 
 JavaScript can be used to detect the visitor's browser - A JavaScript can be used to detect the 
visitor's browser, and - depending on the browser - load another page specifically designed for that
